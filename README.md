Recent development in AI (Artificially Intelligent) has led to fear of human unemployment. This paper hopes to 
separate them and keep them independent of each other. So that both can continue developing without interfering 
with each other.
This paper aims to resolve the clash between human and AI development by making a set of guidelines that can be 
followed in AI and Robotic development to prevent them from entering human fields.
Following the Guidelines will keep robots in fields that humans cannot enter. Hence preventing clashing.
This paper is still in development and is ongoing research.
